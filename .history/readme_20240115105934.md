# Introduction

This app is intended to support creating accessible presentations with Microsoft Powerpoint.
When a presentation is uploaded it returns an audit of the presentation that shows you what formatting is being used and whether your images have a description (also used as alt tag).

This project is open source, you have permission to fork and rework in your own way. If you do, please share back with the community. It is hosted on Heroku which since 2022 is no longer free. We pay with our own money to keep this active, please use it as much as you need and tell us if anything doesn't work right.

## Technologies

This app uses:
- Python 3+
- Flask
- Virtualenv
- A number of Python and Flask modules (see requirements.txt)

As long as you have Python 3 installed, the rest takes care of itself and is packaged into `.flaskenv`.

# Setting up (MacOS)

To develop on MacOS you will need to check you have `Python3` installed and also install `virtualenv`.

Open terminal and type:
`python3 -V`

If it returns a line with `Python 3.x.x` then you have Python installed and updated.

## Python 3 and everything that comes with it.
All other requirements are installed once you create a virtual environment and run the app for the first time.

It's a Python app that uses Flask as a web framework to allow it to be run online.
The repository includes functionality for the service to run on Heroku as a hosted instance off the product branch.

## Setup virtual environment

The safest way to run this is by using a virtual python environment.

To install virtualenv for Python type:
`pip install virtualenv`
or 
`sudo pip3 install virtualenv`

To create a new virtual environment for your project, go to the root directory for the project in your terminal and type:
`virtualenv venv`

### Loading the virtual environment

To run the server go to the root directory for the project in your terminal and type:
`source venv/bin/activate`

You will now see that the server is running. To stop it type:
`deactivate`

**HINT** Don't deactivate the server until you have stopped running Flask.

### Install requirements

All the required modules for the app are listed in `requirements.txt`.
With your virtual environment running, you should install the requirements from terminal and type:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Flask

This a webapp using Flask to run Python code on the web.
The dependencies for Flask will all be loaded the first time you run virtualenv.

To utilise the .flaskenv file that sets up basic app environment variables, like using the debug mode type:
`python -m flask run`

To start the Flask service without using the .flaskenv type:
`flask run`

To stop flask from terminal (on Mac) hold down `ctrl+c`

## App Tools
In `pptx.xsl` you can activate a debug mode for the XSL template.
`param name="debug"` to 1 to activate.

# Features

You can upload any powerpoint file created post 2007 with the extension `.pptx` and the app will return the slides in stripped down form and highlight your titles, text, lists and images so you can check the semantic order, and whether your images have included descriptions.

Now you can go back to your presentation and update the missing attributes and reorder them so that screen readers will be able to deliver the presentation as you intended.
